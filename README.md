# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game

## Overview
The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game between two players. This project is a simple Python implementation of the game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the computer randomly selects a choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the user inputs their choice. The game determines the winner based on standard rules.

## Features
##### Player vs Computer: The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options.
##### Multiple Rounds: Play as many rounds as you like and keep track of the score.
##### Object-Oriented Design: The game is structured using classes and objects for better modularity and code management.

## Game Rules
##### Rock beats Scissors
##### Scissors beats Paper

## How It Works
##### Game Setup: The game starts by asking the user for their choice between rock, paper, or scissors.
##### Computer's Turn: The computer randomly selects its choice.
